This download (via FTP) provides Coronaviridae family-containing SRA runs detected with NCBI's kmer analysis (STAT) tool. 
It provides corresponding SRA run (SRR), sample (SRS), and submission (SRA) accessions, as well as BioSample and BioProject accessions. 
The STAT kmer analysis was performed via a two-step process with a 32-mer coarse database and a 64-mer fine database. 
The database is generated from RefSeq genomes and the viral genome set from nt using a minhash-based approach. 
Results include records with at least a single kmer hit, but are not manually reviewed and may contain false positives.
